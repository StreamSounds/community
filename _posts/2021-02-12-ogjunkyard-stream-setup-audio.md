Has anyone ever told you that you have the voice of a car crash?

Hey folks, it's OGJunkyard.

### What are you going to teach me?

Like I mentioned earlier, I'm going to cover the pieces that went into my streaming setup, why I chose them, what I'd do differently (or not), and what I'd recommend you do.

But first, let's understand the basics. In ["Modern Recording Techniques" by David Miles Huber (Amazon affiliate link)](https://amzn.to/2Xtbpwj), Huber talks about what it takes to make a song sound good, and that is (in order):

```
Good musician
+ good instrument
+ good performance
+ good acoustics
+ good mic
+ good placement
==================
good sound.
```

If you have someone that can't play a guitar well enough to save their life, it doesn't matter if you give them the best guitar ever made recorded by a microphone made by God himself, they just aren't going to make a good sound on the recording.

On the other hand, you can hand Jack White (from The White Stripes, The Raconteurs, The Dead Weather, etc.) a glass soda bottle, a piece of wood, a few nails, and a pickup plugged into an amp, and he's going to make something come out that sounds pretty decent.

(By the way, the documentary *[It Might Get Loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul6xOdPCsCE)* is a great film to watch if you love learning about how incredible guitar players think about music.)

What you see in that Jack White clip is the first half of that "Good Sound" equation. You see a good musician with a (questionably) decent instrument with a good performance. The part you don't see is all the hardware/technology for the good recording: good acoustics and a good mic with good placement. Sometimes this is a microphone in front of an amp, but most often, this is a direct feed of the audio signal from the instrument into the recording device.

Also in the film *It Might Get Loud*, The Edge from U2 says, "I drive everyone crazy trying to get the sound in my head to come out of the speakers. It's my voice." For me, streaming is the exact same way. I'm FANATICAL about how my stream looks and sounds. I want to address every single issue that gets in the way of me putting out the best content I can, and that's what I want to teach you how to do from the technical and gear side with this series of posts.

So, without any further belaboring, let's get into it.

### Audio

The fastest way to get someone to leave your stream is to have it look REALLY good, but sound like it's coming over a walkie talkie or have some audio issue that they can't explain away, such as a hum or click. Even if the viewer can explain it away (such as you being outside on a windy day), they may still bounce. If I go into a stream and there's a sound that I can't see and is annoying, I'm gone within seconds. In fact, audio is such a critical component of the stream experience, bad audio can even make viewers nauseous.

Here's an example of some sounds and poor audio that drive people away:

- Being too far away from the Microphone or too close to it.
- An audio setup so quiet that I have to turn EVERYTHING up to max just to hear you and/or your game.
- Unbalanced audio so it sounds like everything is coming out of one side of a pair of headphones.
- Mumbling into the microphone.
- Screaming into the microphone and destroying everyones' ear drums.
- Audio mixing the game louder than the streamer so the streamer can't be heard over talking scenes.

And for a few more subtle things:

- A hum or hiss. (A fan blowing in the background towards the microphone.)
- Clicking and popping. (Yeah, that real nice mechanical keyboard that you love so much probably has driven off at least a dozen people who would have been regular viewers.)
- A lack of sound because you aren't talking, are muted, or your audio isn't set up correctly. (Seriously, the easiest way to troll a streamer is to say you can't hear them when they come back from BRB screen.)
- Audio that constantly moves back and forth between the left and right stereo channels.

It wasn't until I went through a 3-month-long film production workshop that I realized just how heavily engineered the audio is on a big budget film. It was during this workshop that I learned how much microphones pick up, especially condenser microphones. We had to shoot our own short films for the workshop and when it came to editing audio, if it wasn't a pristine take, it came out over the speakers. We weren't using $1,000+ microphones for these films, but $100-$200 microphones that are easily in financial reach of a surprisingly large number of streamers.

There are other issues streamers have to fight with as well that aren't immediately obvious, such as "AC hum" or "audio hum". AC hum is a continuous background noise (commonly a hum or hiss) that occurs when audio is fed from one device to another and the devices are plugged into different wall sockets, creating a minor electrical imbalance that ends up in the audio signal. We'll get more into AC hum and how to fix it later in this post.

The easiest way to find these background issues is to listen to your VODs with headphones in a quiet room at a volume louder than you normally would have your stream playing. You'd be surprised what you can hear in the background:

- Neighbor's dog? Yep.
- Roommate walking down the hall? Yep.
- Someone laughing on the phone on the other side of the house? That too.
- That firetruck 17 blocks away? Probably.

The rule of thumb I carry with me on stream is, "If I can hear it, the audience can hear it."

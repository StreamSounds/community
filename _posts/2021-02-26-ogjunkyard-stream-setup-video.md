Have you ever wondered what another streamer's setup looks like? What microphone did they buy? What camera do they use? Why is it ALL so sharp? How did they set everything up?

Hey folks, it's OGJunkyard. When I'm watching streams, I ALWAYS wonder how they got it to look the way they did. As streamers, we scrutinize EVERY detail of our streams, and we are always looking for ways that we can raise our production value in hopes that it will help us score that extra follow, subscriber, or headshot. Sometimes, it comes down to the way we lay out our streaming software, such as OBS, and other times it comes down to doing clever tricks and promoting ourselves well. But, one of the most important things before we get to any of that stuff is having the best gear we can and use it well.

In this three-part post series, I'm going to talk about what makes a stream great and break down my streaming setup in *excruciating* detail. I'll talk about why I've made just about every single decision I've made about practically every piece of gear I own because A LOT of thought has gone into this setup. I'm going to talk about the thought behind all of the choices, but it all comes down to being fanatical about the viewer's experience.

Just to give you some context, I've spent OVER $10,000 on my streaming setup over the course of 7 years. Some of these choices have been great, others could have been money better spent (or not spent at all). Later in the post, I'll also give you a breakdown on what I'd recommend you upgrade in what order. I'll also have some recommendations at various price points for the big ticket items (Camera, Microphone, etc.) so you can spend your money smarter when it's right for you. At the very bottom, I'll have a table of all of my gear and links on where to find it.

I may present information and/or topics you haven't heard of before and I'll do my best to link out to resources as well, but if you need to look something up that I may have missed, go right ahead.  If you don't understand what something is or you need more help, please join us in the [StreamSounds Discord Server](https://discord.streamsounds.tv) and ask us questions. We'd LOVE to help you improve!

### Who is this series for?

The information is for streamers who know they are going to be streaming for the long haul. You know you are at this point when you've been streaming for at least 3-6 months on a consistent schedule. You are probably streaming 3 or more days per week. You probably have 10+ average viewers. You don't cancel streams and you do your best to be on time for every stream. You take it seriously, and for you, this is becoming more than a hobby and something you may want to eventually do as a job/career.

Maybe you've made some basic upgrades already, but you are not quite sure what your next purchases should be. You know you definitely want your stream to look nicer than LOLTyler1's stream but definitely can't drop the big bucks on a S-Tier setup like Ninja.

Even though my setup cost over $10,000, I'm not asking you to spend that. In fact, I don't want you to spend that until you decide that each and every one of those items are worth it and makes sense for your content. I'd much rather you to pick the right upgrades at the right times and your community help you get these upgrades. Upgrades can make great donation goals for your community to chip into, by the way.

### A cautionary note

Upgrades will not magically make your stream 10x better and get you 10x as many subs as you were before. Your growth should drive your stream upgrades, not the other way around. Think of stream upgrades as the reward your community gets on your journey of growth. It is validation that you are delivering great content and makes the stream a better entertainment experience for your community, NOT YOU. It's nice having a great looking and sounding stream, but if no one's watching, was the money worth it?

### What are you going to teach me?

Like I mentioned earlier, I'm going to cover the pieces that went into my streaming setup, why I chose them, what I'd do differently (or not), and what I'd recommend you do.

But first, let's understand the basics. In ["Modern Recording Techniques" by David Miles Huber (Amazon affiliate link)](https://amzn.to/2Xtbpwj), Huber talks about what it takes to make a song sound good, and that is (in order):

```
Good musician
+ good instrument
+ good performance
+ good acoustics
+ good mic
+ good placement
==================
good sound.
```

If you have someone that can't play a guitar well enough to save their life, it doesn't matter if you give them the best guitar ever made recorded by a microphone made by God himself, they just aren't going to make a good sound on the recording.

On the other hand, you can hand Jack White (from The White Stripes, The Raconteurs, The Dead Weather, etc.) a glass soda bottle, a piece of wood, a few nails, and a pickup plugged into an amp, and he's going to make something come out that sounds pretty decent.

[Click here if you want proof.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnsQRpgYmaE)

(By the way, the documentary *[It Might Get Loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul6xOdPCsCE)* is a great film to watch if you love learning about how incredible guitar players think about music.)

What you see in that Jack White clip is the first half of that "Good Sound" equation. You see a good musician with a (questionably) decent instrument with a good performance. The part you don't see is all the hardware/technology for the good recording: good acoustics and a good mic with good placement. Sometimes this is a microphone in front of an amp, but most often, this is a direct feed of the audio signal from the instrument into the recording device.

Also in the film *It Might Get Loud*, The Edge from U2 says, "I drive everyone crazy trying to get the sound in my head to come out of the speakers. It's my voice." For me, streaming is the exact same way. I'm FANATICAL about how my stream looks and sounds. I want to address every single issue that gets in the way of me putting out the best content I can, and that's what I want to teach you how to do from the technical and gear side with this series of posts.

So, without any further belaboring, let's get into it.

### Audio

The fastest way to get someone to leave your stream is to have it look REALLY good, but sound like it's coming over a walkie talkie or have some audio issue that they can't explain away, such as a hum or click. Even if the viewer can explain it away (such as you being outside on a windy day), they may still bounce. If I go into a stream and there's a sound that I can't see and is annoying, I'm gone within seconds. In fact, audio is such a critical component of the stream experience, bad audio can even make viewers nauseous.

Here's an example of some sounds and poor audio that drive people away:

- Being too far away from the Microphone or too close to it.
- An audio setup so quiet that I have to turn EVERYTHING up to max just to hear you and/or your game.
- Unbalanced audio so it sounds like everything is coming out of one side of a pair of headphones.
- Mumbling into the microphone.
- Screaming into the microphone and destroying everyones' ear drums.
- Audio mixing the game louder than the streamer so the streamer can't be heard over talking scenes.

And for a few more subtle things:

- A hum or hiss. (A fan blowing in the background towards the microphone.)
- Clicking and popping. (Yeah, that real nice mechanical keyboard that you love so much probably has driven off at least a dozen people who would have been regular viewers.)
- A lack of sound because you aren't talking, are muted, or your audio isn't set up correctly. (Seriously, the easiest way to troll a streamer is to say you can't hear them when they come back from BRB screen.)
- Audio that constantly moves back and forth between the left and right stereo channels.

It wasn't until I went through a 3-month-long film production workshop that I realized just how heavily engineered the audio is on a big budget film. It was during this workshop that I learned how much microphones pick up, especially condenser microphones. We had to shoot our own short films for the workshop and when it came to editing audio, if it wasn't a pristine take, it came out over the speakers. We weren't using $1,000+ microphones for these films, but $100-$200 microphones that are easily in financial reach of a surprisingly large number of streamers.

There are other issues streamers have to fight with as well that aren't immediately obvious, such as "AC hum" or "audio hum". AC hum is a continuous background noise (commonly a hum or hiss) that occurs when audio is fed from one device to another and the devices are plugged into different wall sockets, creating a minor electrical imbalance that ends up in the audio signal. We'll get more into AC hum and how to fix it later in this post.

The easiest way to find these background issues is to listen to your VODs with headphones in a quiet room at a volume louder than you normally would have your stream playing. You'd be surprised what you can hear in the background:

- Neighbor's dog? Yep.
- Roommate walking down the hall? Yep.
- Someone laughing on the phone on the other side of the house? That too.
- That firetruck 17 blocks away? Probably.

The rule of thumb I carry with me on stream is, "If I can hear it, the audience can hear it."

### Video

We can't give audio all the credit for driving away your viewers. There's some stuff that ticks your viewers off when they watch your stream as well.

- Streaming directly from a console. (I'm looking at you Playstation 4 streamers.)
- Covering up too much of the gameplay.
- A poorly done green screen. ("What's that fuzz on the screen?")
- A camera so small I can't make out the person. (Is this a webcam for ants?)
- Not being able to watch in a resolution that works for them. ("I can't watch your 1080p stream on my iPhone in a tunnel!")



### The Streaming PC

The backbone of your entire stream that holds everything together is what you are streaming from, and in most cases, that's a Streaming PC. Here's a few things your streaming PC does that can cause people to bounce out of your stream:

- A stuttering and choppy stream. ("This jank will be over in a minute, trust me.")
- Being unreliable. ("Hang on guys, we're gonna need a quick reboot. Please don't leave!")
- Being on WiFi. ("Ugh, my neighbor started her microwave again?!")

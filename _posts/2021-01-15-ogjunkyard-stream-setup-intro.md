Have you ever wondered what a streamer's setup looks like? What microphone did they buy? What camera do they use? Why is it ALL so clean?

Hey folks, it's OGJunkyard. When I'm watching streams, I ALWAYS wonder how they got it to look the way they did. As streamers, we scrutinize EVERY detail of our streams, and we are always looking for ways that we can raise our production value in hopes that it will help us score that extra follow, subscriber, or headshot. Sometimes, it comes down to the way we lay out our streaming software, such as OBS, and other times it comes down to doing clever tricks and promoting ourselves well. But, one of the most important things before we get to any of that stuff is having the best gear we can and use it well.

In this three-part post series, I'm going to talk about what makes a stream great and break down my streaming setup in *excruciating* detail. I'll talk about why I've made just about every single decision I've made about practically every piece of gear I own because A LOT of thought has gone into this setup. I'm going to talk about the thought behind all of the choices, but it all comes down to being fanatical about the viewer's experience.

Just to give you some context, I've spent OVER $10,000 on my streaming setup over the course of 7 years. Some of these choices have been great, others could have been money better spent (or not spent at all). In the conclusion of the series, I'll also give you a breakdown on what I'd recommend you upgrade in what order. I'll also have some recommendations at various price points for the big ticket items (Camera, Microphone, etc.) so you can spend your money smarter when it's right for you. At the very bottom, I have a table of all of my gear and links on where to find it.

I may present information and/or topics you haven't heard of before and I'll do my best to link out to resources as well, but if you need to look something up that I may have missed, go right ahead.  If you don't understand what something is or you need more help, please join us in the [StreamSounds Discord Server]({{ site.streamsounds.discord }}) and ask us questions. We'd LOVE to help you improve!

### Who is this series for?

The information is for streamers who know they are going to be streaming for the long haul. You know you are at this point when you've been streaming for at least 3-6 months on a consistent schedule. You are probably streaming 3 or more days per week. You probably have 10+ average viewers. You don't cancel streams and you do your best to be on time for every stream. You take it seriously, and for you, this is becoming more than a hobby and something you may want to eventually do as a job/career.

Maybe you've made some basic upgrades already, but you are not quite sure what your next purchases should be. You know you definitely want your stream to look nicer than LOLTyler1's stream but definitely can't drop the big bucks on a S-Tier setup like Ninja.

Even though my setup cost over $10,000, I'm not asking you to spend that. In fact, I don't want you to spend that until you decide that each and every one of those items are worth it and makes sense for your content. I'd much rather you to pick the right upgrades at the right times and your community help you get these upgrades. Upgrades can make great donation goals for your community to chip into, by the way.

### A cautionary note

Upgrades will not magically make your stream 10x better and get you 10x as many subs as you were before. Your growth should drive your stream upgrades, not the other way around. Think of stream upgrades as the reward your community gets on your journey of growth. It is validation that you are delivering great content and makes the stream a better entertainment experience for your community, NOT YOU. It's nice having a great looking and sounding stream, but if no one's watching, was the money worth it?

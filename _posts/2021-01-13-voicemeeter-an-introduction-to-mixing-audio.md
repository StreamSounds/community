Want to try mixing your audio and eventually have an easier time making adjustments? Don't want to invest in a physical mixer or GoXLR/Elgato Wave with other Digital Mixing software? Come check out this introduction to Voicemeeter, a digital mixing software to help organize your audio.

### - Introduction

Greetings fellow streamers and content creators. Are you interested in taking your audio to the next level but don't have a physical mixer or GoXLR type device such as the GoXLR, GoXLR Mini or Elgato Wave software included with the Elgato Wave microphones? Maybe you are interested in seeing how audio mixing works but don't want to fully commit to a physical device or put tons of money into just to try out? Well, guess what? There are options to try out! While it might not exactly stack up to having physical knobs and sliders to adjust, there is a digital option called Voicemeeter.

You might ask, hey Flav, what is voice meeter? You know what? I can answer that! Voicemeeter is a digital mixing software available as donationware for windows that allows you to pull in different sources of audio and allow for advanced audio routing and configuration. The base version of voicemeeter and banana version are free. The potato version has 30 days and then it periodically asks you for a one time donation to get a key and unlock it fully.

Before we get too far into this, I want to state my experience for reference. I have personally used all three versions of voicemeeter. I swapped between Banana and Potato frequently for over a year and a half as of Jan 2021. I did a great many things with it and I absolutely love the software. Am I still using it? My personal setup doesn't really require the use of it anymore so not entirely. I still fire up both Banana and Potato versions periodically to refresh my knowledge on it so I can help others fix any problems or set it up. If at any point you have questions about Voicemeeter or even other subjects, the Library by Streamsounds does have a discord server ready for you to hop into if you need any help or just want to chat. Technology interests us greatly and we would love to chat! Anyways, back to the article!

Who might want to use voicemeeter? Anyone who is wanting more control over their audio and doesn't have either a physical mixer or other digital mixer such as the GoXLR / GoXLRMini or Elgato Wave Microphones. Elgato Wave Microphone as mixing software? Yeah! Maybe some day I will be able to acquire some of these and do hands on research on them. If you happen to be someone interested in giving Voicemeeter a shot then lets hop right in?

What do we need to get started? We have a few options, we have Base Voicemeeter, Voicemeeter Banana, and Voicemeeter Potato. For the most part, I am skipping the setup of Base Voicemeeter. My reasons for this are that I don't believe it offers sufficient customization alone while Voicemeeter Banana is the same price of free and offers way more features. I'll be covering a feature comparison, just know I don't think it is worth trying to use Base Voicemeeter over Banana, especially for a stream setup.

Now, if you would like to install the programs before I go over the very basic features and follow along, you can find them here: https://vb-audio.com/index.htm. I also highly recommend grabbing the Virtual Audio Cables as well. Virtual Audio Cables are useful to help with the routing of audio and will be used in some, if not all, of the setups. Installation might require a restart.

### - Parts Explanations

Voicemeeter? Banana? Potato? Marco? Polo? Right! The versions can be a little tricky at first but I will give a bit of an overview of the differences. Firstly, lets get a quick overview of the terms for things that are to come up.

The basics are Hardware Inputs, Digital Inputs, and Hardware Outputs. You will likely notice that I will be refraining from going into depth on individual features in this article and mostly want to give a sum of the basics to get started. The extra features I would like to cover in a different article altogether.

Lets go over what each of the basic pieces are. Hardware Inputs are typically something like a microphone, line input, or similar things. The Virtual Input is basically a digital audio device/cable. (I will get more into these in one of the setups and further explain them.) Lastly, we have Hardware Ouputs, these are things like headphones, speakers, or in the case of what we will be configuring for streaming in the setup part, a digital audio device/cable.

[picture of a fully setup voicemeeter maybe?]

All of these options can be confusing when first looking at them so what I will do is break down each portion per version of voicemeeter. The portions covered at this moment will be Hardware Outputs, then Digital Inputs, then Hardware Inputs. Why does it seem like I'll be going backwards from what I originally listed? Unlike what the program looks like, which is the order up above, this new order is based on being able to check to make sure everything is getting set up properly as you go. You need your outputs such as headphones for testing audio to make sure the inputs are set up properly. If we set all our inputs up and then our outputs, we would be blaring everything all together and testing would be more difficult.

So here are the Hardwar Output sections:

Base Voicemeeter has Two Hardware Outputs:

]

Voicemeeter Banana has Three Hardware Outputs:

]

Voicemeeter Potato has Five Hardware Outputs:

]

You will notice the A1-5 with a down arrow next to it. Upon clicking these you will be given a list of options you have available on your computer for outputting audio. This is important because you are able to send any source pulled into voice meeter out into each individual output which gets additional controls and adjustable options covered below:

You may notice new features being added going from Base Voicemeeter, to Voicemeeter Banana, then more in Voicemeeter Potato. Base Voicemeeter gets a Mix Down, Stereo REpeat, Composite toggle, mono toggle and mute toggle. Banana gains a mode selector, and EQ. Potato gains FX Returns.

Next is our built in virtual audio devices that are available and installed alongside installing any of the voicemeeter programs. Base Voicemeeter gains a single virtual audio device: 'VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO'. Banana comes with a second virtual audio device: 'VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO Aux'. Then Potato comes with a third virtual audio device called 'VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO3'. These virtual audio devices will show up in windows sound settings and are selectable per individual application as well. I wont directly cover setting these up yet as I think it will be easier to understand them going through the setup process. These are extra internal audio devices just built in to help with audio routing.

Along with having a single built in virtual audio cable, base voicemeeter also starts with a basic equalizer for Bass, Med, and Highs, adjustable individually. A front, rear, left and right room correction grid. A volume/gain slider and a mute button. Alongside the volume/gain slider you will also see an >A and >B, these correspond to the hardware outs and sending audio to individual ones as selected. I will go over this in a setup portion as it will be easier to understand that way. Banana is basically similar except it has two virtual inputs build in. Potato is where a big change happens. In Potato there is more room and under each individual virtual input you gain a listing of different applications pushing audio to that input. You are also able to adjust and mute volume per individual application without the need to go through windows sound settings to do so. Those are the only differences for this section and I will give an image per program to show what they look like.

Alright, seem like a lot? I agree! When I first started messing with Voicemeeter I was like... what?  But over time I was like... I can do what with this? It ended up being amazing and I still use it for certain projects. Ahem... Anyways, lets discuss the last section of a basic setup. Hardware Inputs! Again, these cover microphones, line inputs (such as a 3.5mm in) or even digital audio drivers for extra audio routing.

Just like Hardware Outputs and Virtual Inputs, there are different features added in Banana and Potato than what comes with Base Voicemeeter. Base Voicemeeter gets the gain slider, a mute, mono selector ( triggers mono channeling where the same signal is sent equally through both stereo outputs. It helps some mics that for some reason only pull in through one side in some cases and it helps to balance that one sided input to both ears on output.) Banana gains a compressor and noise gate over Base Voicemeeter. Potato gains Special Effects: Reverb, Delay, and separate Sends for each. I will give an image per program to show what they look like:

Alright, that explains the whole of voicemeter right? Go have fun with it! I just, I jest. That was mostly just trying to help you understand each part before running through a setup. When is setup? Setup is now! and it is the fun part! First off, we are going to do something different than I have seen a lot of guides do. We are going to skip around to setting up our outputs first. This way we can leave our current setup alone and you can listen to music or do other things, maybe even come say hello to use in the Library discord? [liiiink the discord here] We would be glad to ahve you and discuss things. Semi-guilt-feeling discord link aside, lets get back into setting up Voicemeeter!

This might seem weird but,.. Lets skip regular Voicemeeter and go straight to that Banana! Yeah! Ba na na... You thought I was going to sing there? (I totally was just now), Anyways, my reason for skipping Base Voicemeeter is actually because I honestly feel like it lacks a lot of functionality that just warrants skipping it, especially since Banana is the same price of free and offers way more features and functionality. If you haven't already, this is where you would want to install Voicemeeter Banana and the extra Virtual Audio Cable(s). If you installed Voicemeeter Potato, it also installs Voicemeeter Banana. Got everything installed? Cool! Open up Voicemeeter Banana please and this is what you should see:

Something that typically gets skipped in other Voicemeeter coverage that I've seen is the ability to save settings. At any point you can save your current settings of Voicemeeter by going to Menu -> Save Settings. This saves a settings file on your computer you can then load up from just a file even on other devices should you want to transfer your settings to another device. If at any point you feel lost and want to restart the setup, you can go to Menu -> Reset Settings ( Re-Initialization) and this will make Voicemeeter appear as if you had just installed it, blank with nothing set up.

Voicemeeter Banana is likely flashing in the top right telling you to set up a hardware output? For good reason! you can't hear anything you are adjusting if you haven't set it up. This is ok and you should go ahead and do this. One of the Three Hardware Outputs should be your listening device (headphones, speakers, other). This is so that you wil be able to hear things once we set audio to run through voicemeeter. Another one should also be a virtual audio cable that you may have installed, it could be named such as 'VB Audio Cable'. What will we be doing with this virtual audio device? We will be sending our stream audio to it!

Oh, you might have noticed that the list that pops up is repetitive with some minor variances? That is because on your computer there are different drivers which can be interacted with. In some cased WDM type drivers work better, in others MME type drivers work better. I suggest starting with WDM. If that turns out wonky you can try MME. I might cover more on the differences later but for now lets just try WDM to start! Alright, that will be all for this part, your hardware outputs should look a little something like this:

Banana Hardware Outs Setup:

You know what we need now? Some audio to thread into these outputs! Thats what! When do we want this audio? We Want this audio yesteryear! So lets get some of that audio. In windows we need to open sound settings, it doesn't matter how we get there, whether you search in the start menu or right click the speaker icon in the task tray thing likely on the bottom right of windows unless you moved your task bar. If right clicking on the speaker icon it should be called 'Open Sound Settings' and if going through the Start Menu it will be just 'Sound Settings'. Under output we will choose our output device, this is our main output of all audio. Lets change this to 'Voicemeeter VAIO'. You may notice that if you had audio going through your listening device it likely disapeared. This is because it is now routed to the Virtual Input Voicemeeter VAIO. If you look inside Voicemeeter Banana, you should now see the audio bar boincing if you are playing audio. Do you want to hear it? Tak ea look at A1-3 and toggle the one that matches the A beside your headphones/speakers.

You should hear the audio now going from Voicemeeter VAIO to your headphones/speakers. If so? Congratulations! If not? Maybe please try again. If you have any issues going through this, remember I am available in our discord and would like to know any issues so I can help fix or find fixes for the and update this article based on them. (Likely will start adding FAQ to the bottom as they come in.)

So what do we do with that virtual audio cable in Hardware Outputs? I'm going to guess you are looking into this as a streamer and to better answer that, lets finish up our devices. You might have noticed we haven't mentioned setting up the microphone? We are going to do that now. It doesn't matter which spot but we are going to use the first one in Hardware Inputs. If you click on 'select input device' you should get a bunch of options. I suggest the WDM version of your microphone, whatever it may be called. After selecting your microphone you may start to see the audio bar moving and it is probably picking up audio from your microphone and you may not hear it yet. That is because it has to be set to push audio to the hardware outs, just like virtual inputs had to be set to do so.

If you want to hear it yourself, set it to the appropriate A1-3 and give it a listen. You can adjust the IntelliPan to add some HI/Lo or Echo effects. If your voice comes out your headphones through one side it is likely set to stereo input but only pushes mono audio which then gets pushed into one side of the stereo channels sometimes depending on the device and setup. You can fix this by toggling the MONO button on that device. It should light up green and audio will be equally pushed to left and right channels. An example of this setup is below:

Mic Input Example:

Do you want to combine this audio with the computer audio being pulled in through Voicemeeter VAIO? Well, that is where this gets interesting. That virtual audio cable you may have set up as a second Hardware Out is what we will use for this. Similar to how we set everything to go through headphones, we will toggle the appropriate A# button under both the microphone and hardware input and Voicemeeter VAIO virtual input. Here is what it should look about like now depending on how you set up your hardware outputs:

Small tidbit of information, if you want to label each of the inputs you can right click on them and it comes up with a box to type in. If you put what you want in there and push enter a label should appear above them.

Here is what an example of what labeling looks like:

Huzzah! We have success right? Or we should at least! Everything should look properly routed on Banana but if you want to check by pulling the virtual cable in as an OBS Input you could check that as well. Speaking of which, I believe it is time to set up OBS with our properly routed Voicemeeter Banana outputs. With the hardware part out of the way lets get our sound into OBS! Open up your version of OBS and go to Settings -> Audio. For this all we do is set Desktop Audio to the Virtual Cable we are using a Hardware Out in Voicemeeter Banana. In this instance it will be 'Cable Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)'. Disable everything else since we are using Voicemeeter Banana to route all our audio to one place.

It should look a little something like this:
{

You might ask, what about alerts? I'm going to wager your alerts are being pulled into your OBs via browser source. You set these up your normal way and when you do, make sure to set Control Audio Via OBS. This will give you an audio level bar in the Audio Mixer portion of OBS.

{


  picture of above here:



}

You will notice a cog options menu icon beside the specific Audio Source in the Audio Mixer. Click this and you will see a menu and something that reads Advanced Audio Properties which opens a window like this:

{



  picture of above Here



}

Select 'Monitor and Output' for the Alerts you want to hear. Then go into Settings->Audio->Advanced Section->Monitoring Device: Set this to 'VoicMeeter Aux Input (VB-Audio VoiceMeeter Aux VAIO)'

{



  picture of above here



}

Now go to your Voicemeeter Banana application and test some Alerts. You should see the Voicemeeter AUX audio bouncing around. Since we are pulling the audio into OBS via Browser Source and both Outputting and Monitoring, all we need is to push this audio to our headphones so we can hear when things happen. So select whichever A# is your headphones underneath Voicemeeter AUX and test again to make sure you ca hear it.

I believe this covers the whole setup for using Voicemeeter Banana and OBS. At a later point I will be going over how to add Discord and other applications to the mix. At some point I may cover a Potato version setup. Speaking of Potato, if you feel like the amount of inputs / ouputs are not enough you can give Potato a shot. The setup is very similar. I covered the differences up above but it does have a small cost. If you don't need to or don't want to invest money into it in the next 30 days or so, you could be just fine with Banana for free.

This article covered the bare bones of Voicemeeter and should be good to get you started. If you want to know about specific setups that can be done, please come ask about them in the discord. At some point I will be adding more specific setups in another post including: Setting Up Discord With Voicemeeter, Setting up Game Mic Audio with Voicemeeter, Setting Specific Output of Apps to Specific Digital Audio Cables.

I am going to guess you already know about audio leveling and adjustments and how to set that up. If not we will be doing an article on that as well. Or if you would like help with it prior to us releasing the article we are available in the discord! yay another discord plug lol

(it might take us longer to get that out as we are spending significant amount of time on it to make sure to enrich the article with proper help and it covers way more than just setting up an audio mixing application, if you are interested in it we thank you for your patience while we work to get it developed and put out there. I will update this article with a link to that one once it is available)

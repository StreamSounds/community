It's the bedrock of every stream, and if your foundation's shaky, can you deliver your best?

Hey folks, it's OGJunkyard.



### The Streaming PC

The backbone of your entire stream that holds everything together is what you are streaming from, and in most cases, that's a Streaming PC. Here's a few things your streaming PC does that can cause people to bounce out of your stream:

- A stuttering and choppy stream. ("This jank will be over in a minute, trust me.")
- Being unreliable. ("Hang on guys, we're gonna need a quick reboot. Please don't leave!")
- Being on WiFi. ("Ugh, my neighbor started her microwave again?!")

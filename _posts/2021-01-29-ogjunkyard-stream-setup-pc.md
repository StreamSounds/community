It's the bedrock of every stream, and if your foundation's cracked, broken, and shaky, can you deliver your best?

Hey folks, it's OGJunkyard.

Today, we are talking about streaming PCs and what goes into them. This is often times the first major upgrade streamers make, and if we get this right, we are typically set for 3+ years of streaming day in, day out.

We are talking about individual component selection (at a high level) and what options are out there for some of the more streamer-focused parts. We'll talk about ways to build your setup to support more cameras, audio sources, and peripherals to help you drive your stream.

Finally, we'll talk specifically about my streaming PC, what I've got in it, and how it's all hooked up for streaming.

### The Quality Difference

Before we get into the details of what goes into a streaming PC, let's talk about the quality difference a streaming PC can make. To illustrate this point first, I want to show you a few clips from my Twitch stream. To get started, we'll look at some "before" clips when I was streaming off a 2012 MacBook Pro and gaming on a Nintendo Switch. At the time, I was using a Blackmagic Design Intensity Shuttle to feed in the game signal to my MacBook, and I was limited to streaming at 720p at 30 frames per second (FPS):

In Before Clip \#1, I want you to notice the little blocky-looking artifacts, the blurriness in the overall image, and the mediocre frame rate. You can see little skips and stutters in the gameplay, especially as the camera pans around Donkey Kong waiting for the race to start, and the Lakitu holding the starting lights in the top left.

In Before Clip \#2, when the speed picks up during the race and the race goes around a corner, you'll notice that even my webcam image in the lower left-hand corner takes a hit, even though I'm not really moving. The edges of the webcam get soft. Devices that are underpowered REALLY suffer when it comes to fast moving action where a lot of the game environment is sliding across the screen. First-Person Shooter games really suffer from this as it's very easy for the player to whip the camera around really fast. 

After I spent a few months streaming this way, I decided to upgrade to an actual streaming PC in late 2018. I was incredibly nervous that this wouldn't be a worthwhile investment (even though I was streaming 20-50 hours a week on a computer built in 2012). I spent a lot of time researching components and talking to friends. I bought everything on a Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale on [NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com).

The VERY first stream, I noticed a big quality improvement. See here for yourself:

### The (Hypothetical) Streaming PC

The backbone of your entire stream that holds everything together is what you are streaming from, and in most cases, that's a Streaming PC. Here's a few things your streaming PC does that can cause people to bounce out of your stream:

- A stuttering and choppy stream. ("This jank will be over in a minute, trust me.")
- Being unreliable. ("Hang on guys, we're gonna need a quick reboot. Please don't leave!")
- Being on WiFi. ("Ugh, my neighbor started her microwave again?!")

For people streaming and gaming on the same device (console or PC), you are taking a quality hit on two fronts. You are using the same resources to run two different demanding workloads: Gaming and Streaming. You are asking your device to take resources away from running the game efficiently and effectively to produce a stream, which also takes a hit because it doesn't have all the resources available that it should in the first place.

## DMCA - what is it?

[<dfn>DMCA</dfn>] is an acronym for the Digital Milleninium Copyright Act. It is a U.S. copyright law which addresses the rights and obligations of owners of copyrighted material who believe their rights under the U.S. copyright law have been infringed. Necessary? Maybe. Should we adhere to it? Ofcourse we should! How though? By abiding by copyright law.

TLDR: Provided is a list that is thoroughly vetted for terms and conditions and licenses that explicitly grants a user the allowance to use certain distributed music for either commercial/non-commercial usage. Whether it be in streaming, recorded content, or game development. They have been manually verified before being added to the list, and unless something has changed they should be fine to use. Links for double checking the information are also provided. If you wish to skip past the rest of the content in this blog to get to the list you can.

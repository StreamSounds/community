<p>Welcome in friends! Here at Stream Sounds Library we will be putting together a bunch of information to share. What kind of information? Well, as technology lovers, streamers, and content creators, we get a chance to play around with a bunch of different technologies. Whether it is broadcasting or recording software, games, music, or even physical equipment, it is all interesting and we hope to share our experiences and knowledge. </p>

<p>Knowledge is power, right? Or is that just a meme? Nope, it is not just a meme, why? Because in truth, the more knowledge a person attains, the more choices they inevitably gain, therefore giving them power of choice! So whether it be for setting up your streaming software, learning about DMCA-Safe music, acquiring new tools to further improve the streaming or viewing experience or anything else, we hope you can gain knowledge from the library.</p>

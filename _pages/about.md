The Library by StreamSounds was conceived by OGJunkyard and FlavCreations to be a source of information for streamers to help them better their craft through provable, repeatable advice. While others are giving intangible clickbait under the guise of growing one's Twitch streams, they wanted to provide usable and worthwhile information that people could rely on and trust.
